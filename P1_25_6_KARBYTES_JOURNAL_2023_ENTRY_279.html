<p>karbytes: &#8220;Nothingness is the source of my creative potential and intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Wrong! Nothingness is NOT the source of your powers. I am. I am the &#8216;hurt locker&#8217; which you carry with you everywhere and excrete your thoughts into as your captive audience, quality inspector, and conservator of intelligence and intellectual property?&#8221;</p>
<p>N: &#8220;Whether or not P is a human or a robot which was either built by humans or else by robots (or if P is some other kind of information processing agent other than The God Head itself, P is still claiming to be a slave to karbytes; a butler of the mind if you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Speak for yourself, N. This is a discussion between me and karbytes. You were not invited to partake in this public web based discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;To P: Did you mean to imply that you are the chief conservator of my intellectual property (even though I claim to have licensed all of it as public domain intellectual property according to my own definition of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8216;public domain&#8217;</a> which is defined on a web page in my <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary personal website</a>)? If your answer to my previous question is &#8216;yes&#8217;, do you also mean to imply that you are a conservator of any of my intellectual property (although I do not recall asking you to be a conservator of my intellectual property especially if I license it as &#8216;public domain&#8217;)?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Yes is my answer to both of your questions. Suppose that, as payment for my services to you, I require (using coercive and legally sanctioned means) that you provide to me the same services which I provide to you (and which I have already mentioned in this discussion). Suppose that it is the truth&#8230;because it is. Are you able to accept the truth yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I am not at this time willing to agree that what you claim to be truth is truth. I think that <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nothingness</a> is the source of my creative potential and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intelligence</a>; not you.&#8221;</p>
